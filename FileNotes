"""This File is a notes file for explaining, and learning how file adding, sorting, creation, etc... works inside of python
   This is being learned from automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter 8"""

"""To Understand this you should have a basic understanding of how file navigation works"""

#This imports the os code which are shortcuts for file navigation inside of python
import os 

#This is how you can return a string that auto defines the proper file slasher depending on your OS (\windows VS. /for OS X and Linux
os.path.join('usr', 'bin', 'spam')
"""Windows would print
    usr\\bin\\spam (double \\ firt to 'exit' python script second to define '\'
  OS X and Linux would print
    user/bin/spam (Only needs one since / doesnt defining enything in python)"""

#This uses a list to create several strings of file navigation based off of the files in the string
myFiles = ['accounts.txt', 'details.csv', 'invite.docx']
for filename in myFiles:
        print(os.path.join('C:\\Users\\asweigart', filename))
C:\Users\asweigart\accounts.txt
C:\Users\asweigart\details.csv
