"""Character Input:

    mesasge addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 yearse old.
    
    Extras: 
            Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and printing out that many copies of 
            the previous message. (Hint: order of operations exists in Python)
            Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines. 
            (Hint: the string "\n is the same as pressing the ENTER button)

"""Things I want to change in Future Versions: \n

    Figure out a more optimal way for the while loops with t
    Add More ways to detect wrong answers of age, and name"""
